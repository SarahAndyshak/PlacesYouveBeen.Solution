WE HAVE LEARNED!!!
- Variable names must be the same in all locations. Check public, private variables.
- To update/add entry boxes:
    add form entry to New.cshtml, 
    add variables to Place.cs -- public string and to constructor
    add line to Show.cshtml with Dynamic razor to get new variable info
    update PlacesController.cs to add new variables in Create() (line 23)
